# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database

# Introduction
In this project, we will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 
For this project, we will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 
To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

All of the below instructions are discussed in detail as we work through on our way to completing this project.
The below serves as a quick reference of what we will be doing as we progress through the completion of this project.

# Instructions
we will need to follow the instructions on the next three concepts to get the Chinook database up and running on our own machine. 
There will be two parts to this project.
- The first part is a series of questions that will assure we have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons.
- The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project.
